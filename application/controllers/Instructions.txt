For this Project, the following should be obeyed;
        All the project will be done through git.
        No one is to edit the assets files unless you are adding your own.
        You only pull from the master branch.
        Please create a branch for each controller you are working on.
        In case your controller needs or depends on another controller, merge with the desired controller for smooth operation

        An individual works on one's controller and only one, and does not change anything in the other controllers.
        For each controller you are working on, create a folder with the same name as the controller on the models and the views and this are the folders
            you are to work with only.
        No controller rather module given to an individual should be left hanging.
        Each module should be completed in the time given lest penalties will be incurred

        Naming conventions;
            All functions should be one word (verbs)
            All folder names should start with small letters
            Models should start with a capital letter
